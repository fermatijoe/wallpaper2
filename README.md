# Wallhouse
A wallpaper app
## Getting Started
The app provides countless wallpapers and is developed while trying to follow the material design and general android specifications. Anyways there is room for improvements and if you wish to contribute to this repo I give you a big thank you.

The project was made possible by [AlphaCoders](https://wall.alphacoders.com/api.php), where I suggest you to request an API KEY if you wish to do intesive test so that you don't overload mine. I will obfuscate the API KEY nontheless as soon as I pusblish the app to the play store. The API KEY should be put [HERE](https://github.com/fermatijoe/wallpaper2/blob/5a06b81eec06e9f1bd6d53447774ea1918594530/app/src/main/java/com/dcs/wallhouse/tasks/WallpaperTask.java#L91).

## Libraries
There are quite a lot of dependencies: Glide, Toasty, PhotoView, Palette, MaterialSearchView, MaterialDrawer, SugarORM.
